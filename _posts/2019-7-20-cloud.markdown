# Cloud types
>According to the World Meteorological Organization's International Cloud Atlas, more than 100 types of clouds exist. The many variations, however, can be grouped into one of 10 basic types depending on their general shape and height in the sky. Thus, the 10 types are:  [Detail:The 10 Basic Types of Clouds](https://www.thoughtco.com/types-of-clouds-recognize-in-the-sky-4025569)

1. Low-level clouds (cumulus, stratus, stratocumulus) that lie below 6,500 feet (1,981 m)
2. iddle clouds (altocumulus, nimbostratus, altostratus) that form between 6,500 and 20,000 feet (1981–6,096 m)
3. High-level clouds (cirrus, cirrocumulus, cirrostratus) that form above 20,000 feet (6,096 m)
4. Cumulonimbus, which tower across the low, middle, and upper atmosphere

## relation between cloud type and weather
>We surface observers admire clouds for their beauty, but clouds are more than just pretty puffs. In fact, clouds can help you predict upcoming weather. Look out for these eight cloud types next time you're out backpacking or boating to avoid being caught off guard by a "sudden" rainfall or thunderstorm.
